<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>SDL2, or Simple DirectMedia Layer 2, is a cross-platform library designed for handling graphics, audio, input, and other multimedia elements. It is widely used for the development of video games and multimedia applications.</p>
<p>Here are some key features of SDL2:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cross-platform: SDL2 works on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android, allowing developers to create applications that run on multiple operating systems.</li>
  <li>Graphics Management: SDL2 allows you to draw 2D graphics and manage textures, surfaces and images.</li>
  <li>Audio Support: The library allows playing sounds and music, making it easy to integrate audio into applications.</li>
  <li>Input Management: SDL2 manages input from keyboards, mice, gamepads, and other devices.</li>
  <li>Extensibility: SDL2 is often used with other libraries to extend its functionality, such as OpenGL for 3D graphics.</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, SDL2 is a powerful and flexible tool for developers looking to create multimedia applications and games.</p>
